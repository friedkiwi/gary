# Gary

Gary is a (WIP) CP/M emulator using SDL as a rendering engine. Gary's goal is to be simple, small and portable with a low learning curve.

## Usage
  
Gary is very much unfinished right now, and will not run any code at all yet.

Todo list:

* Implement I/O devices and display I/O
* Write a CP/M BIOS
* Boot to CP/M Prompt

## Why Gary

This emulator is named after Gary Kildall, the original author of CP/M. I've chosen to name it after him to, sadly posthumously, give him the recognition he deserves for being one of the pioneers in the early microcomputer revolution.

## Why writing this software

As a learning exercise, mainly. The Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 are fairly simple CPUs, and writing an emulator is a good way to exercise your coding skills. I'm also using this project as a testbed to exercise new CI/CD and code auditing tools to improve my understanding of those.
